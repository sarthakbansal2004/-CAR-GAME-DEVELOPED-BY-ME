# -CAR-GAME-DEVELOPED-BY-ME

I have developed this game by the help of Unity Engine and C#. I have also put audio in this game and this game work with the help of Keyboard. 

INSTRUCTION: Car move forwards by using 'pg up' Button and car move right by using '>' button and car move left by using '<' button. And also score present in the top of the game screen. This is also my third game those developed by me.

Game's file is more than 25MB, so it is unable to upload on Gibhub, so I uploaded this file to MediaFire
